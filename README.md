# Core Features

## Smart Transaction Management

Track:
- Income
- Expenses
- Transfers
- Recurring payments

Transactions can be created through:
- Manual input
- AI/NLP chat commands
- OCR receipt scanning

Examples:
- "I spent 75k for coffee at Starbucks"
- "Add internet bill 350k for this month"

The AI automatically extracts:
- Amount
- Merchant
- Category
- Transaction type
- Date

Before saving, every AI-generated transaction goes through a preview & confirmation flow to avoid incorrect data.

## AI Financial Assistant (Claude AI)

Powered by Anthropic Claude.

Users can:
- Ask financial questions
- Generate spending summaries
- Analyze monthly expenses
- Receive budgeting insights
- Detect unusual spending habits
- Get financial recommendations

Examples:
- "How much did I spend on food this month?"
- "Summarize my expenses this week"
- "Why is my spending higher this month?"
- "Give me saving suggestions"

---

## NLP Transaction Creation

Users can create transactions naturally through chat.

Examples:
- "Paid Netflix subscription 169k"
- "Bought groceries 250k at Alfamart"
- "Salary received 8 million"

The AI converts natural language into structured transactions automatically.

---

## OCR Receipt Scanner

Upload or scan receipts and the system will:
- Extract text using OCR
- Detect merchant name
- Detect total amount
- Categorize transaction
- Generate structured transaction preview

Supported flow:
1. Upload receipt image
2. OCR + AI processing
3. Preview extracted data
4. User confirmation
5. Save transaction

This reduces manual finance tracking friction significantly.

# CI/CD Deployment

Production deployment uses `docker-compose.prd.yaml` from the repository and Jenkins. The pipeline builds the Go API image, pushes it to the registry, sends the compose file and runtime environment to a temporary remote directory, then runs `docker compose up -d` with a health check.

Expected Jenkins credentials:

- `saku-finance-api-env` as secret file containing the production API `.env`
- `docker-registry-host` as secret text, without protocol
- `docker-registry-username` as secret text
- `docker-registry-credentials` as secret text for the registry password or access token
- `ganipedia-host-ssh-server` as secret text
- `ganipedia-host-ssh-port` as secret text
- `ganipedia-host-ssh-user` as secret text
- `ganipedia-host-ssh-password` as secret text

No permanent compose or `.env` file is required on the server. Jenkins writes them to a temporary remote directory for the deploy command and removes them after the deployment script exits. The API is attached to the `saku-finance` Docker network with alias `api-saku-finance` and listens on internal port `4001`.
